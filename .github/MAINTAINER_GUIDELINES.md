# Maintainer Guidelines

This file outlines the few directives we have for project maintainers.

- Do not merge PRs you create.
- Do not merge PRs until 24 hours have passed since it was opened. Exceptions include:
  - Emergency fixes.
    - Try to get secondary maintainer approval before merging if you are able to.
  - PRs with empty commits intended to generate a changelog.
- Do not merge PRs that contain content from the [banned content list](./CONTRIBUTING.md#banned-content).

These are not steadfast rules as maintainers are expected to use their best judgement when operating.

Our team is entirely voluntary, as such we extend our thanks to maintainers, issue managers, and contributors alike for helping keep the project alive.
